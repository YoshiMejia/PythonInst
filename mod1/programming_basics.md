## 1.4  Compilation vs. interpretation

There are 2 diff ways of transforming a program from a high-level language into machine language

Compilation - The source program gets translated once by getting a file which contains the machine code (although this act is repeated any time the source code is modified). The program that performs this translation is called a compiler/translator. 

Interpretation - You or any other user of the code can translate the source program every time it needs to be run. Whichever program performs this kind of transformation is called an interpreter. It also means you cant just distribute the source code as-is, bs the end-user also needs the interpreter to execute it. 

## 1.5 What does the interpreter actually do? 
- All computer programs are text files, which is what gets read by the interpreter. The Interpreter reads the source code and checks if all lines are correct (syntax, etc).
- if the interpreter finds an error, it exits immediately and results in an *error message* 

## 1.6 Compilation vs. interpretation - advantages and disadvantages
Python is an interpreted language, to run a program in Python we'll need the Python Interpreter. 

##1.2.2 Python goals
-an **easy and intuitive** language just as powerful as those of the major competitors;
-**open source**, so anyone can contribute to its development;
-code that is as **understandable** as plain English;
-**suitable for everyday tasks**, allowing for short development times.

##1.2.4 Python Rivals
-Perl – a scripting language originally authored by Larry Wall;
-Ruby – a scripting language originally authored by Yukihiro Matsumoto.

Perl is more traditional&conservative than Python and resembles C.

Ruby, on the other hand, is more innovative than Python. 


## Why not Python?
Despite Python's growing popularity, there are still some niches where Python is absent, or is rarely seen:

-low-level programming (sometimes called "close to metal" programming): if you want to implement an extremely effective driver or graphical engine, you wouldn't use Python;
-applications for mobile devices: although this territory is still waiting to be conquered by Python, it will most likely happen someday.
