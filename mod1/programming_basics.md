## 1.4  Compilation vs. interpretation

There are 2 diff ways of transforming a program from a high-level language into machine language

Compilation - The source program gets translated once by getting a file which contains the machine code (although this act is repeated any time the source code is modified). The program that performs this translation is called a compiler/translator. 

Interpretation - You or any other user of the code can translate the source program every time it needs to be run. Whichever program performs this kind of transformation is called an interpreter. It also means you cant just distribute the source code as-is, bs the end-user also needs the interpreter to execute it. 

## 1.5 What does the interpreter actually do? 
- All computer programs are text files, which is what gets read by the interpreter. The Interpreter reads the source code and checks if all lines are correct (syntax, etc).
- if the interpreter finds an error, it exits immediately and results in an *error message* 

## 1.6 Compilation vs. interpretation - advantages and disadvantages
Python is an interpreted language, to run a program in Pythin we'll need the Python Interpreter.
