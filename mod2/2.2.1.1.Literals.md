## Literals - the data in itself

A literal is data whose values are determined by the literal data itself.

## Integers: octal and hexadecimal numbers
If an integer number is preceded by an 0O or 0o prefix (zero-o), it will be treated as an octal value. This means that the number must contain digits taken from the [0..7] range only.
0o123 is an octal number with a (decimal) value equal to 83.

The second convention allows us to use hexadecimal numbers. Such numbers should be preceded by the prefix 0x or 0X (zero-x).
0x123 is a hexadecimal number with a (decimal) value equal to 291.

## Floats
you can omit zero when it is the only digit in front of or after the decimal point.

In essence, you can write the value 0.4 as:

.4

For example: the value of 4.0 could be written as:

4.

This will change neither its type nor its value.

## Integer vs Float
When you want to use any numbers that are very large or very small, you can use scientific notation.


Take, for example, the speed of light, expressed in meters per second. Written directly it would look like this: 300000000.

To avoid writing out so many zeros, physics textbooks use an abbreviated form, which you have probably already seen: 3 x 108.

In Python, the same effect is achieved in a slightly different way - take a look:

3E8

The letter E (you can also use the lower-case letter e - it comes from the word exponent) is a concise record of the phrase times ten to the power of.

Note:

the exponent (the value after the E) has to be an integer;
the base (the value in front of the E) may be an integer.
