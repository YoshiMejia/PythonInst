## Arithmetic operators: exponentiation

A ** (double asterisk) sign is an exponentiation (power) operator. Its left argument is the base, its right, the exponent.

print(2 ** 3) #=> 8
print(2 ** 3.) #=> 8.0
print(2. ** 3) #=> 8.0
print(2. ** 3.) #=> 8.0

-> when both ** arguments are integers, the result is an integer, too;
-> when at least one ** argument is a float, the result is a float, too.

## Arithmetic operators: division
A / (slash) sign is a divisional operator.

The value in front of the slash is a **dividend**, the value behind the slash, a **divisor.**

print(6 / 3) #=> 2.0
print(6 / 3.) #=> 2.0
print(6. / 3) #=> 2.0
print(6. / 3.) #=> 2.0

The result produced by the division operator is always a float, regardless of whether or not the result seems to be a float at first glance: 1 / 2, or if it looks like a pure integer: 2 / 1.

## Arithmetic operators: integer division

A // double slash is an **integer divisional operator**. Integer division can also be called floor division. It's different from the regular / single slash divisor because;
- its output lacks the fractional portion, meaning the result is always a flat integer and not a float.
- it conforms to the integer vs float rule

print(6 // 3) #=> 2
print(6 // 3.) #=> 2.0
print(6. // 3) #=> 2.0
print(6. // 3.) #=> 2.0

(compare to results above) 

As you can see, integer by integer division gives an integer result. All other cases produce floats.
