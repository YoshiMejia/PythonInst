## Arithmetic operators: exponentiation

A ** (double asterisk) sign is an exponentiation (power) operator. Its left argument is the base, its right, the exponent.

print(2 ** 3) #=> 8
print(2 ** 3.) #=> 8.0
print(2. ** 3) #=> 8.0
print(2. ** 3.) #=> 8.0

-> when both ** arguments are integers, the result is an integer, too;
-> when at least one ** argument is a float, the result is a float, too.

## Arithmetic operators: division
A / (slash) sign is a divisional operator.

The value in front of the slash is a **dividend**, the value behind the slash, a **divisor.**

print(6 / 3) #=> 2.0
print(6 / 3.) #=> 2.0
print(6. / 3) #=> 2.0
print(6. / 3.) #=> 2.0

The result produced by the division operator is always a float, regardless of whether or not the result seems to be a float at first glance: 1 / 2, or if it looks like a pure integer: 2 / 1.

## Arithmetic operators: integer division

A // double slash is an **integer divisional operator**. Integer division can also be called floor division. It's different from the regular / single slash divisor because;
- its output lacks the fractional portion, meaning the result is always a flat integer and not a float.
- it conforms to the integer vs float rule

print(6 // 3) #=> 2
print(6 // 3.) #=> 2.0
print(6. // 3) #=> 2.0
print(6. // 3.) #=> 2.0

(compare to results above) 

As you can see, integer by integer division gives an integer result. All other cases produce floats.

## Operators: remainder (modulo)
The result of the % modulo operator is a remainder left after the integer division.

Take a look at the snippet - try to predict its result and then run it:

print(14 % 4)


As you can see, the result is two. This is why:

14 // 4 gives 3 → this is the integer **quotient**; (4 goes into 14 3 times evenly) 
3 * 4 gives 12 → as a result of **quotient and divisor multiplication;** 
14 - 12 gives 2 → this is the remainder.

## Operators: how not to divide
As you probably know, division by zero doesn't work.

Do not try to:

perform a division by zero;
perform an integer division by zero;
find a remainder of a division by zero.
