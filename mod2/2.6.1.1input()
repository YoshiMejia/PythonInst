## The input() function

print() sends data to the console, meanwhile input() gets data from the user and returns that data to the program.

## The input() function with an argument

the input() function can also prompt the user by passing in an argument of the prompt you want the user to see

anything = input("Tell me anything...")
print("Hmm...", anything, "...Really?")

## the result of the input() function

^ ...is a string which contains the users input

## The input() function - prohibited operations

anything = input("Enter a number: ")
something = anything ** 2.0
print(anything, "to the power of 2 is", something)

This is prohibited.

This should be obvious - can you predict the value of "to be or not to be" raised to the power of 2? We can't. Python can't either.
