## Conditions and conditional execution
The first form of a conditional statement, which you can see below is written very informally but figuratively:

if true_or_not:
    do_this_if_true

# Conditional execution: the if statement & indentation

Take a look at the following code:

if sheep_counter >= 120:
    make_a_bed()
    take_a_shower()
    sleep_and_dream()
feed_the_sheepdogs()


As you can see, making a bed, taking a shower and falling asleep and dreaming are all executed conditionally - when sheep_counter reaches the desired limit.

Feeding the sheepdogs, however, is always done (i.e., the feed_the_sheepdogs() function is not indented and does not belong to the if block, which means it is always executed.)

# Conditional execution: the if-else statement

syntax: 

if true_or_false_condition:
    perform_if_condition_true
else:
    perform_if_condition_false

# Nested if-else statements

if the_weather_is_good:
    if nice_restaurant_is_found:
        have_lunch()
    else:
        eat_a_sandwich()
else:
    if tickets_are_available:
        go_to_the_theater()
    else:
        go_shopping()

# The elif statement
elif is used to check more than just one condition, and to stop when the first statement which is true is found.

if the_weather_is_good:
    go_for_a_walk()
elif tickets_are_available:
    go_to_the_theater()
elif table_is_available:
    go_for_lunch()
else:
    play_chess_at_home()
    
The way to assemble subsequent if-elif-else statements is sometimes called a cascade.
-you mustn't use else without a preceding if;
-else is always the last branch of the cascade, regardless of whether you've used elif or not;
-else is an optional part of the cascade, and may be omitted;
-if there is an else branch in the cascade, only one of all the branches is executed;
-if there is no else branch, it's possible that none of the available branches is executed.

## Analyzing code samples

// Read two numbers
number1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
number2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

// Choose the larger number
if number1 > number2:
    larger_number = number1
else:
    larger_number = number2

// Print the result
print("The larger number is:", larger_number)

------

// Read two numbers
number1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
number2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

// Choose the larger number
if number1 > number2: larger_number = number1
else: larger_number = number2

// Print the result
print("The larger number is:", larger_number)

--------

// Read three numbers
number1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
number2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
number3 = int(input("Enter the third number: "))

// We temporarily assume that the first number is the largest one.
// We will verify this soon.
largest_number = number1

// We check if the second number is larger than current largest_number
// and update largest_number if needed.
if number2 > largest_number:
    largest_number = number2

// We check if the third number is larger than current largest_number
// and update largest_number if needed.
if number3 > largest_number:
    largest_number = number3

// Print the result
print("The largest number is:", largest_number)
