## Looping your code with while

In general, in Python, a loop can be represented as follows:

while conditional_expression:
    instruction
    
// Store the current largest number here.
largest_number = -999999999

// Input the first value.
number = int(input("Enter a number or type -1 to stop: "))

// If the number is not equal to -1, continue.
while number != -1:
    // Is number larger than largest_number?
    if number > largest_number:
        // Yes, update largest_number.
        largest_number = number
    // Input the next number.
    number = int(input("Enter a number or type -1 to stop: "))

// Print the largest number.
print("The largest number is:", largest_number)

# Using a counter variable to exit a loop

counter = 5
while counter:
    print("Inside the loop.", counter)
    counter -= 1
print("Outside the loop.", counter)

# Looping your code with for
The for loop is designed to do more complicated tasks - it can "browse" large collections of data item by item. 

for i in range(100):
    # do_something()
    pass

There are some new elements. Let us tell you about them:

-the for keyword opens the for loop; note - there's no condition after it; you don't have to think about conditions, as they're checked internally, without any intervention;
-any variable after the for keyword is the control variable of the loop; it counts the loop's turns, and does it automatically;
-the in keyword introduces a syntax element describing the range of possible values being assigned to the control variable;
-the range() function (this is a very special function) is responsible for generating all the desired values of the control variable; in our example, the function will create (we can even say that it will feed the loop with) subsequent values from the following set: 0, 1, 2 .. 97, 98, 99; note: in this case, the range() function starts its job from 0 and finishes it one step (one integer number) before the value of its argument;
-note the pass keyword inside the loop body - it does nothing at all; it's an empty instruction - we put it here because the for loop's syntax demands at least one instruction inside the body (by the way - if, elif, else and while express the same thing)
