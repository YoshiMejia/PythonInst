## Bubble sort
 we compare the adjacent elements, and by swapping some of them, we achieve our goal.
 
 my_list = [8, 10, 6, 2, 4]  // list to sort
swapped = True  // set to True for it to enter the while loop.

while swapped: // while swapped remains True 
    swapped = False  # no swaps so far
    for i in range(len(my_list) - 1): // make the loop conditional on the actual number length, instead of it being for i in my_list cause then that way we couldn't do my_list[i + 1] on the next line to access the next element
        if my_list[i] > my_list[i + 1]: // if the current element is greater than the one next to it
            swapped = True  // set swapped to true to continue the loop
            my_list[i], my_list[i + 1] = my_list[i + 1], my_list[i] // switch around the variables

print(my_list) // once Swapped gets set and remains False, you exit the loop and print the result

# Key takeaways

1. You can use the sort() method to sort elements of a list, e.g.:

lst = [5, 3, 1, 2, 4]
print(lst)

lst.sort()
print(lst)  # outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


2. There is also a list method called reverse(), which you can use to reverse the list, e.g.:

lst = [5, 3, 1, 2, 4]
print(lst)

lst.reverse()
print(lst)  # outputs: [4, 2, 1, 3, 5]
