-> A complete set of known commands is called an **instruction list**, sometimes abbreviated to **IL**. Different types of computers may vary depending on the size of their ILs, and the instructions could be completely different in different models.

-> The IL is, in fact, the alphabet of a machine language. This is the simplest and most primary set of symbols we can use to give commands to a computer. It's the computer's mother tongue.
 
-> A program written in a high-level programming language is called a **source code** (in contrast to the machine code executed by computers). Similarly, the file containing the source code is called the source file.

-> Due to historical reasons, languages designed to be utilized in the interpretation manner are often called **scripting languages**, while the source programs encoded using them are called **scripts**.

print("My name is", "Python.")
print("Monty Python.")

-> **binary system** - the system computers use for storing numbers, and that they can perform any operation upon them

-> **an operator** is a symbol of the programming language, which is able to operate on values.
